Problem: [Whatâ€™s Your Best Scrabble
String?](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-your-best-scrabble-string/)

This repo contains source code for my `riddler_2019_06_28` program,
which is a command-line tool I used to solve the Riddler problem of
finding the highest-scoring string using the one hundred standard
Scrabble tiles.

A high-level description of the solution is that it entails a genetic
algorithm along with a few other subcommands that I used to manually
twiddle with high-scoring strings to feed back into the genetic
algorithm as new inputs.

My gut feeling is this approach is not optimal. I think a better
approach would have been to rank all the words in the dictionary and to
build a string based on the densest-scoring words that share prefixes
and suffixes in addition to not sharing too many of the same tiles. My
tool allows for the first part of ranking all the words in the
dictionary, but the harder part of finding optimal strings is something
I ran out of time and motivation to pursue.
